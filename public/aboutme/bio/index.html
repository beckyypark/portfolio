<meta name="description" content="Hi, I’m Rebecca
But most know me as Becca!
I’m a recent graduate of the University of Notre Dame, where I studied Business Analytics and Global Affairs. My academic path brought together core business foundations—marketing, finance, accounting, economics, and management—with deeper training in data analytics, programming, and decision-making under uncertainty. Alongside my Business Analytics education, my Global Affairs education grounded me in international relations, development, and policy analysis, sharpening my ability to evaluate problems within complex global and institutional contexts. This blend taught me to see problems not just as technical challenges, but as systems shaped by policy, culture, and people.">
