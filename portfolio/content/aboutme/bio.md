## Hi, I’m Rebecca
### But most know me as Becca!

I’m a recent graduate of the University of Notre Dame, where I studied Business Analytics and Global Affairs. My academic path brought together core business foundations—marketing, finance, accounting, economics, and management—with deeper training in data analytics, programming, and decision-making under uncertainty. Alongside my Business Analytics education, my Global Affairs education grounded me in international relations, development, and policy analysis, sharpening my ability to evaluate problems within complex global and institutional contexts. This blend taught me to see problems not just as technical challenges, but as systems shaped by policy, culture, and people.

Today, I work as an Associate in Accounting Advisory Services (AAS) on the Innovative Technology Solutions (ITS) team at KPMG. I build data-driven solutions and custom workflows that support U.S. companies in Deal Advisory and Strategy, translating complex client questions into actionable insights at deal speed. My work lives at the intersection of analytics and business landscapes, using tools like Excel, SQL, Alteryx, Smartsheets, and KPMG’s KART interface, alongside close collaboration with multidisciplinary teams. 

Along with industry experience, I’ve spent several years in consulting-style environments through Notre Dame’s Student International Business Council (SIBC), working with organizations such as West Monroe, Kaufman Hall, HealthScape Advisors, Deloitte South Korea, and KPMG. These projects strengthened my ability to lead teams, navigate ambiguity, analyze markets and technologies, and communicate clearly with diverse stakeholders.

Outside of professional work, I care deeply about community, mentorship, and cultural engagement. I served as President of the Korean Student Association, building inclusive spaces through cultural programming and events, worked as a teaching assistant, helping students develop analytical thinking and client-focused problem-solving skills, and developed community through my role as a resident assistant for my hall community. 

At the core of everything I do is a love for learning, collaboration, and thoughtful problem-solving. What lights my fire is working at the intersection of business, technology, and global impact. I’m always excited for opportunities to keep building, questioning, and growing.
